<p class="left">I'm an Iranian software developer ,user interface designer and user experience designer.I'm a minutiae-obsessed passionate Interactive Developer and Designer with both love for the look of the site as the brilliance happening behind the scenes with over 10 years of UI/UX design and development experience under my belt. My main focus lies with the client side of the web but still maintain a good understanding of server side code.<br/>
I fall in love with ideas, I'm a person who thrives on learning more and thinking smarter. I live and breathe emerging media which in this profession is key to not falling into the last weeks news.
I work at <a href="http://sheypoor.com">Sheypoor company</a> and I've had the honor to work with some of the most creative, young and talented people in the country over the years.
I love Digital art, javascript and AngularJs. And I enjoy spending time with my family.</p>
