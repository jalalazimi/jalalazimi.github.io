      <p>
        Around Easter 2017 I decided to work on a simple webapp called{' '}
        <a href="//use.delivery">Delivery</a> to help designers share their work
        in progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wanted to create a hassleâ€“free solution, which is reduced to the bare
        minimum of features and requires neither sign-up nor a credit card.

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        Type in your company/client, upload and describe your screens, then
        share with colleagues.&nbsp;Simple.

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        I created Delivery mainly to sharpen my React & MobX skills. Building a
        simple, yet full webapp from the first line of code to deployment in a
        matter of roughly 3 days was a great experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I drew inspiration from makers like{' '}
        <a href="//twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a> and their no-nonsense
        approach to launching new products & experiments early and often.

      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>
        The project is built on top of my{' '}
        <a href="//github.com/fabe/www">personal boilerplate</a>, featuring
        React, MobX, Next.js and MongoDB. I am hosting the images on{' '}
        <span className="caps">AWS</span>, and run the backend on a{' '}
        <a href="//linode.com">Linode</a> server.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full source code is{' '}
        <a href="//github.com/fabe/delivery">available on GitHub</a>.
