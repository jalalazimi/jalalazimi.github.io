            As a designer, I like to focus on projects in the travel and leisure
            industry. I work both as a product designer and a frontend
            developer. Take a look at my work here, or browse my side projects.
            Right now, I study Interface Design at the University of Applied
            Sciences in Potsdam and work as a freelancer.
